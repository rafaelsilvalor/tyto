The inbox/outbox contract of ADR 0011, as code. `fsInbox` lists `inbox/<id>/brief.brief` with `assets/` as the asset base and `ack` **moves** a finished task to `done/` rather than deleting it; `fsOutbox` writes `outbox/<id>/out/` with every file renamed into place, so no reader can pick up half a PNG — the atomicity the pipeline deliberately delegated. `result.json` has a Zod schema, validated before writing, with `status` answering correctness and `cancelled` plus the counts answering completeness.

Also the first adapters for two ports `core` has been asking questions of since E3.3, and one the exporters needed: `nodeFileSystem` (`FileSystem`), `fileAssetResolver` (`AssetResolver`, hashing content so the same brief plus the same assets produce the same bytes), and `fileResources`, which reads an asset folder into the synchronous data-URI lookups the exporters take. `pollSource` is the watcher of ADR 0008 — polling, because `fs.watch` reports a folder while it is still being copied into, and it never acks, because only the handler knows whether the work succeeded.
