TYTO-205: a delivery carries its brief in `editaveis/` and the images the brief used in `assets/` (ADR 0057). The desktop export box now delivers into the picked folder — artwork at the top, `editaveis/`, `assets/` — and `tyto render --folder` gains `assets/` under its `<out>/<brief-name>/` level. The copied brief's image paths name the copies, and a brief in a folder named `editaveis` also reads `../assets`, so it renders again from where it sits. `E_ASSET_NOT_FOUND` names the folders actually searched.
