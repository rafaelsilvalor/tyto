TYTO-127: exporting again into a folder used before removes what the previous export wrote there and this one did not produce, and says so (ADR 0054). It applies to `tyto render --folder` and to the desktop's export box. `--out`, `tyto watch` and the queue panel are unchanged.

A carousel edited from four slides down to three no longer delivers the fourth, and a delivery made before ADR 0053 loses its `lamina-*` files on the first export after the upgrade. Only a file the previous `result.json` listed can go, and only while its size is still the recorded one. A file somebody added or replaced by hand stays. Each removal is a `W_LEFTOVER_REMOVED` warning on stderr, in `result.json` and in the export box. A kept file is a `W_LEFTOVER_KEPT` with the reason, and a previous report that cannot be read is a `W_PREVIOUS_RESULT_UNREADABLE`.

`@tyto/io`: `fsTaskOutput` takes `removeLeftovers` and, like `fsDeliveryOutput`, returns a `ReusableTaskOutput` whose `removeLeftovers(run)` is called before `finish`.
