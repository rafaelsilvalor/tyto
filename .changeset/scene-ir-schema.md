Add the Scene IR: the Zod schema for `Scene`, `Artwork`, `Frame` and the five node kinds, with types inferred from the schema rather than written twice. `parseScene` validates the shape and then the four cross-node invariants from `docs/ir-schema.md` — unique ids, a mask that points at a real non-descendant node, fonts and assets declared on the scene, no text without runs — and reports every problem it finds, each naming the id at fault.
