### Minor Changes

- e994ca9: TYTO-33 — what the `tyto` command needed from the packages under it.

  `core`: `ResolveOptions.formats`, the `--formats` flag's way in. It is a **fallback and not
  an override**, mirroring `ResolveOptions.template`: the frontmatter's `formats` still wins,
  so there is one rule for a reader rather than two. A format it names that the manifest does
  not render is the same `E_UNKNOWN_FORMAT` the frontmatter would get, with no range attached
  because a flag is not a position in a file. New diagnostic code `E_INPUT_READ`, for a file a
  command was pointed at and could not open — `E_TEMPLATE_READ` was the nearest thing and its
  summary is about templates.

  `pipeline`: `JobRequest.formats`, passed straight to `resolve`. The job does not filter
  frames afterwards — a frame nobody asked for should never be built, not built and dropped.

  `io`: `fsTaskOutput(directory)`, the `TaskOutput` over one folder that `fsOutbox` is now
  written in terms of. `tyto render --out <dir>` writes into exactly the folder it was given
  (`docs/integrations.md`), while the outbox derives `<root>/<id>/out` from a task id; the
  atomic write underneath is the part neither may have its own copy of. Also
  `fileTemplateAssets(...)`, which reads the files beside a `template.html` that its `src=`
  attributes name — `markupTemplateSource` has always left that to whoever composes it, and
  before this nothing did, so a template with a `<vector src>` could not render.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3a782b3: `runJob`: a brief in, artifacts out. It composes `parseBrief` → `resolve` → `compile` → `export` → `raster` with every capability injected as a port, names each artifact `<artwork>-<format>.<ext>` (ADR 0011), limits how many frames raster at once, and reports progress through a tagged `JobEvent` union. A three-slide brief in two formats asked for as PNG and SVG produces twelve files.

  Two ports are declared here because nothing else could: `TemplateSource`, since `TemplateRegistry` reads manifests and `compile` needs a build function, and `ArtifactSink`, implemented by `io` in E6.2 — a job with no sink returns its artifacts in memory and opens no files. Every frame is attempted individually with `exportFrameHtml`/`exportFrameSvg`, so one broken frame of twelve is reported alongside the other eleven instead of replacing them; an `AbortSignal` stops the job handing anything further to the sink.

  `@tyto/core` gains two diagnostic codes for what a job can report and no stage could: `E_RENDER_FAILED` for a frame that produced no bytes, and `E_OUTPUT_WRITE` for one that could not be written.
